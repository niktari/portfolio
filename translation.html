            <h1>Code & Knitting</h1>
            <p>There's no doubt that knitting and coding go hand-in-hand. A lot of artists have been exploring the convergence of the two, and the insights and results have been nothing short of stunning. As someone whose practice revolves around translating computationally-generated art into physical outputs, I also wanted to explore the affordances that both code and knitting could offer each other.
            </p>
            <p>I should start by saying that I'm an ok coder and an ok knitter (I'm trying to get better at both). My method for approaching this experiment may have been inefficient, time-consuming, or just wrong. Either way, my primary goal was simple: knit a pattern that was generated by code.

                <h2>Code</h2>
                <p>Something unique to computationally-generated art is randomness, and I wanted to make sure that was a fundamental element of the pattern. Through randomness, interesting visuals can be created, manipulated, or rather, glitched. What would it look like if a continuously-changing force like randomness were captured in something static like a swatch of cloth?</p>
                <p>I ended up developing this knitting chart generator. Use the parameters below to adjust the components of the knitting chart.</p>

                <h2>Knitting</h2>
                <p>To the right are all of the physical supplies needed for knitting. Using a mix of novice intarsia and fair isle knitting techniques, I started to chip away at whatever iteration of the chart I downloaded from the generator. Intarsia knitting — a colorwork technique where you can knit blocks of color and thereby create picturesque patterns — usually requires some intricate planning. Yarn colors and lengths need to be considered in advance. It’s also good to anticipate when and how frequently you need to switch yarn colors. I decided to do this planning manually rather than implement this process within my generator.</p>

                <h2>The Glitch</h2>
                <p>It was interesting to see how something that was 2D (the computationally-generated pattern) now gain dimension, a front and back. The front side of the swatch is clearly the translated knitting chart, but the back side reads differently.
                </p>
                <p>Something notorious about intarsia knitting is the number of yarn tails that are produced. These yarn tails usually hang on the back or “wrong” side of the work. The more often you’re switching colors, especially at inconsistent intervals, the more tails appear. With this in mind, the back side visualizes the glitched areas in a different way. Instead of sporadic stitches, an excess of yarn tails is hanging out of the work.</p>
